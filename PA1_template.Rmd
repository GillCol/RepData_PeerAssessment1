## Coursera: Reproducible Research - Week 2 Project 1

## Introduction: 
This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web 
site: 
Dataset: Activity monitoring data [52K]
The variables included in this dataset are:
        steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
        date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
        interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Check if the data file already exists if not, download/unzip the file
```{r, echo = TRUE}
if (!file.exists("./activity.csv")) {
   
    file_url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
   file_name <- "activity.zip"
   download.file(file_url, file_name, method = "curl")
   unzip(file_name)
}
``` 

Load packages
```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
```

Load the data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

Convert the variables and apply names to columns
```{r, echo = TRUE}
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
activity$interval <- as.factor(activity$interval)
names(activity)
lapply(activity, class)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Data processing - sum the steps per day and remove any missing values
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data <- ddply(activity[,1:2], .(date), function(set) { sum(set$steps, na.rm = TRUE) })
names(data) <- c("date", "steps")
```

Create a Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 12}
ggplot(data = data) + aes(x = factor(date), y = steps) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity") + labs(x ="Date", y = "Total number of steps") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0))

```

Calculate the mean average and median number of total steps taken per day
```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(data$steps)
median(data$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Data processing - calculate the mean steps for each interval and remove any missing values
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data2 <- ddply(activity, .(interval), function(set) { mean(set$steps, na.rm = TRUE) })
names(data2) <- c("interval", "steps")
```

Create a Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 12}
hour_intervals <- c(12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180, 192, 204, 216, 228, 240, 252, 264, 276)

ggplot(data = data2) + aes(x = factor(interval), y = steps, group = 1) + geom_line() + labs(x ="5-minute interval", y = "Average number of steps") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 0)) + geom_vline(xintercept= hour_intervals, linetype="dotted") + geom_vline(xintercept= 144, colour = "red") + geom_text(x=144, y = 150, label="12 pm", angle = 90)
```

Calculate the 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data2[data2$steps == max(data2$steps), ]$interval
```

## Imputing missing values
Calculate the number of rows with missing steps values
```{r, echo = TRUE}
nrow(activity[is.na(activity$steps),])
```
There are 2304 rows with steps = ‘NA’

Develop a strategy for imputing missing data - replace the NAs with the average 5-minute interval based on the day of the week.
# Add a variable to retain the original order of the data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
activity$order <- 1:nrow(activity)
```

Impute the NAs by replacing them with the mean of the total steps
```{r, echo = TRUE}
impute_mean <- function(x) {
  replace(x, is.na(x), mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}

imputed_data <- ddply(activity, .(interval), transform, steps = impute_mean(steps))
```

Data processing - order the data to the original order and apply the variable classes
```{r, echo = TRUE}
imputed_data <- imputed_data[order(imputed_data$order), ]
names(activity)
lapply(activity, class)
```

Now that missing values have been imputed, a histogram can be produced for the total number of steps taken each day. First the data for the plot is prepared by summing the number of steps for each day:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data2 <- ddply(imputed_data[,1:2], .(date), function(set) { sum(set$steps, na.rm = TRUE) })
names(data2) <- c("date", "steps")
```

Create a Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 12}
ggplot(data = data2) + aes(x = factor(date), y = steps) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity") + labs(x ="Date", y = "Total number of steps") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0))
```

Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(data2$steps)
median(data2$steps)
```

Compare the mean and median total number of steps taken before and after the data imputation. 

Results with missing values
Mean: `r format(mean(data$steps), digits = 2)` 
Median: `r format(median(data$steps), digits = 2)` 

Results with imputed missing values
Mean: `r format(mean(data2$steps), digits = 2)` 
Median: `r format(median(data2$steps), digits = 2)` 

Question: Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
Answer: The mean and median are higher in the dataset where the missing values have been imputed.

Question: What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
Answer: The mean and median in the dataset where the missing values have been imputed are equal.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

A factor variable is created in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
dayofweek <- weekdays(imputed_data$date)
imputed_data$dayofweek <- ifelse(dayofweek == "Saturday" | dayofweek == "Sunday" , c("weekend"), c("weekday"))
imputed_data$dayofweek <- factor(imputed_data$dayofweek)
```

Data processing - apply the variable classes
```{r, echo = TRUE}
names(imputed_data)
lapply(imputed_data, class)
```

Calculate the mean number of steps per interval for weekdays
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data_weekdays <- ddply(imputed_data[imputed_data$dayofweek == "weekday", ], .(interval), function(set) { mean(set$steps, na.rm = TRUE) })

names(data_weekdays) <- c("interval", "steps")
```

Calculate the mean number of steps per interval for weekends
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data_weekends <- ddply(imputed_data[imputed_data$dayofweek == "weekend", ], .(interval), function(set) { mean(set$steps, na.rm = TRUE) })

names(data_weekends) <- c("interval", "steps")
```

Create a Panel plot, two time series plots, comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 12}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = data_weekdays) + aes(x = factor(interval), y = steps, group = 1) + geom_line() + labs(x ="5-minute interval", y = "Average number of steps across weekdays") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 0)) + geom_vline(xintercept= hour_intervals, linetype="dotted") + geom_vline(xintercept= 144, colour = "red") + geom_text(x=144, y = 150, label="12 pm", angle = 90)

plot2 <- ggplot(data = data_weekends) + aes(x = factor(interval), y = steps, group = 1) + geom_line() + labs(x ="5-minute interval", y = "Average number of steps across weekends") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 0)) + geom_vline(xintercept= hour_intervals, linetype="dotted") + geom_vline(xintercept= 144, colour = "red") + geom_text(x=144, y = 150, label="12 pm", angle = 90)
```

Function to render both plots http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Multiple_graphs_on_one_page_(ggplot2)) 


```{r, echo = TRUE}
multiplot <- function(..., plotlist=NULL, file, cols=1, layout=NULL) {
  library(grid)
  plots <- c(list(...), plotlist)
  numPlots = length(plots)
  if (is.null(layout)) {
    layout <- matrix(seq(1, cols * ceiling(numPlots/cols)),
                    ncol = cols, nrow = ceiling(numPlots/cols))
  }
 if (numPlots==1) {
    print(plots[[1]])
  } else {
    grid.newpage()
    pushViewport(viewport(layout = grid.layout(nrow(layout), ncol(layout))))
    for (i in 1:numPlots) {
      matchidx <- as.data.frame(which(layout == i, arr.ind = TRUE))
      print(plots[[i]], vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = matchidx$row,
                                  layout.pos.col = matchidx$col))
    }
  }
}
```

Create the panel plots and observe any differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 12}
multiplot(plot1, plot2, cols = 1)
```
Activity seems to be lower during the weekdays compared to the weekends
